# Authelia OIDC Configuration

Two settings in your Authelia `configuration.yml` make Claude.ai connectors **dramatically** more pleasant: long-lived refresh tokens (so you don't have to reconnect every 90 minutes) and pre-configured consent (so you don't get asked to approve scopes on every reconnect).

## 1. Token lifespans

Authelia's defaults are way too short for MCP usage – the default `refresh_token` is only **90 minutes**, after which a full re-authentication is required. Set explicit lifespans under `identity_providers.oidc`:

```yaml
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    # …hmac_secret, jwks, etc. unchanged…

    lifespans:
      access_token: 1h
      authorize_code: 1m
      id_token: 1h
      refresh_token: 90d        # default is 90m – way too short for MCP
```

If you want even longer-lived sessions for some clients (and shorter for others), use named profiles:

```yaml
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    lifespans:
      access_token: 1h
      refresh_token: 90d
      custom:
        long_lived_mcp:
          access_token: 1h
          refresh_token: 365d
    clients:
      - client_id: whatsapp-mcp
        lifespan: long_lived_mcp     # apply the profile to this client
        # …rest of client config…
```

## 2. Pre-configured consent

By default Authelia shows a consent page on every OAuth login. For an MCP server you've already trusted, that gets old fast. Add `consent_mode` and a long `pre_configured_consent_duration` to each MCP client:

```yaml
- client_id: whatsapp-mcp
  client_name: Claude whatsapp-mcp MCP
  authorization_policy: one_factor
  client_secret: $2b$12$REPLACE_ME_BCRYPT_HASH
  redirect_uris:
    - https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback
  scopes: [openid, profile, email, offline_access, address, phone, groups]
  grant_types: [authorization_code, refresh_token]
  response_types: [code]
  token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post
  introspection_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_basic
  consent_mode: pre-configured                  # ← skip consent on subsequent logins
  pre_configured_consent_duration: 1y           # ← cache the consent for 1 year
```

`scopes: [..., offline_access]` is also crucial – without `offline_access` Authelia will not issue a refresh token at all, no matter how long `lifespans.refresh_token` is.

## After changing the config

1. `docker compose restart authelia`
2. **Disconnect + reconnect each MCP connector in Claude.ai** so a new long-lived refresh token is issued (existing sessions keep their old short-lived tokens).
3. Verify in the Authelia logs:
   ```
   docker logs authelia --tail 200 | grep -iE "client|consent"
   ```

## How this works with this server

This server emits an RFC 6750 `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"` header on 401 responses when a token is presented but rejected (expired or invalid). That signals to Claude.ai's OAuth client to run the silent **refresh-token flow** instead of falling back to a full reconnect. The combination of long refresh tokens + the standards-compliant 401 challenge means a connector can stay live for months without manual intervention.
